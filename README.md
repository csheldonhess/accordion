Collapse and expand headings on a webpage
=================

Show and hide parts of an HTML page with the power of jQuery! It also degrades in a super friendly way for browsers with JavaScript turned off&mdash;and looks fine in text-based browsers.

Collapsed:

<img src=images/collapsed.png />

Expanded:

<img src=images/expanded.png />

(Cat photos optional. Thanks to placekitten.com for being awesome!)
